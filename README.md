# PyTorch Tutorial - Originally presented at IST's 6ªs Jornadas de Engenharia Física: 

## Overview

This tutorial is designed to present neural networks from a practical, coding perspective and focus on their implementation via [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
Several notebooks are found in the `notebooks` folder:
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/0_SGD_from_scratch.ipynb) SGD_from_scratch uses a single neuron for trivial classification and regression tasks on pseudodata, implementing backpropagation and weight updates manually in Numpy. 
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/1_Basic_Classification.ipynb) Basic_Classification introduces PyTorch, using a non-trvial, but basic classification problem.
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/2_Basic_Regression.ipynb) Basic_Regression again uses PyTorch to solve a basic regression problem using pseudo-data
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/3_Classification_Application.ipynb)3_Classification_Application is an example using real-world tabular data to training a simple classifier.
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/4_Regression_Application_Exercise.ipynb)4_Regression_Application_Exercise is an exercise using real-world tabular data to training a simple regressor.
1. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/PyTorch_Tutorial/blob/master/notebooks/5_Regression_Application_Completed.ipynb)5_Regression_Application_Completed is an example of how 4_Regression_Application_Exercise could be attempted, including a few tricks for training a regressor.

## Running
The tutorial may either be run via Google Colab by clicking the blue badges, or directly by installing the appropriate Python modules yourself.
